Neurotic-Armageddon-Indicator
=============================

Neurotic Armageddon Indicator (NAI) is an installation artwork which visualises the ‘Doomsday Clock’, a symbolic clock maintained by an academic journal, ‘The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists’. The Doomsday Clock represents the proximity to armageddon expressed as minutes to midnight where midnight represents nuclear holocaust. The clock is ‘set’ by a panel of scientists and experts at long intervals, usually years apart. The latest version of the clock uses a webclient which scrapes the web page of the Bulletin as often as possible and extracts the number of minutes using this figure to update the display.
