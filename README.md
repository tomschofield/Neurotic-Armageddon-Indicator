Neurotic-Armageddon-Indicator
=============================

Neurotic Armageddon Indicator (NAI) is an installation artwork which visualises the ‘Doomsday Clock’, a symbolic clock maintained by an academic journal, ‘The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists’. The Doomsday Clock represents the proximity to armageddon expressed as minutes to midnight where midnight represents nuclear holocaust. The clock is ‘set’ by a panel of scientists and experts at long intervals, usually years apart. The artwork is in two pieces. One is a small computer programme running on a server which ‘scrapes’ the content of the bulletins home page as often as possible. The software checks the current status of the clock and then sends the results over the internet to the second part of the work, a small wall clock which displays the time of the Doomsday Clock on a red LED clock display. This process repeats as fast possible so that the device shows in near-real-time the status of the doomsday clock. At the time of writing, it is currently five minutes to midnight.

A new experimental aspect of NAI is in the web_stuff folder. The idea is that a near identical clock can be updated from a web interface. I'm particularly interested in spaces that this might be deployed where people can engage and perhaps conflict over the 'correct time'.
